Insights derived through Mental Health Data

Through the help of this project I aim to explore the effects of Mental Health on the Tech Industry Employees and the relation between of Health Expenditure of a country and  Health Expectancy from the world happiness report over the years

Instead of classifying a person having a mental health issue as a Boolean value , I have used the approach of providing a score to the user on the basis of the anaswers they have provided in the survey to determine  the level of mental health issue a person has. 
Some of the insights that I focused on were
•	Companies with a smaller number of people have less mental health issue.
•	Companies with large number of employees formally discuss mental health issues with the supervisor.
•	People in the age group 20-30 are most likely to discuss the mental health issues with the supervisor.
•	Countries with High health expenditure improved the healthy score in the happiness report over the years.	

Hypothesis1: We assume that the companies with smaller number of people have less mental health issue and through the help of the line chart we can see that as the number of people in the companies are increasing the Mental Health score is increasing which proves that companies with smaller number of people have less mental health issues.

Hypothesis 2: We assume that Companies with larger number of employees formally discuss the mental health issues with the supervisor, through the stacked bar chart we are able to see that Companies with smaller number of employees are more comfortable with discussing about mental health issues with their supervisor.

Hypothesis 3: We assume that People in the age group 20-30 are most likely to discuss the mental health issues with the supervisor but with the stacked bar chart we can see that people in the age group 60-70 are more comfortable to discuss about their mental health issues compared to the younger people hence the hypothesis is rejected.

Hypothesis 4: Countries with High health expenditure improved the health score in the happiness report over the years 2015-2018. Through the help of Scatter plot we are able to see that there is a slight increase in Health Expentancy as the Health Expenditure is increasing over the years 2015-2018 and With the top 4 countries being United Kingdom, Netherland, Switzerland and Australia with individuals having high Mental health score we can see from their line plot that as over the years the health expenditure in increasing the health score is also increasing and thus we can say that our hypothesis is correct that with the high expenditure the healthy score also increases for a Country.
